# sassy_grid
Working on a lightweight grid layout with options.

My personal compass/sass layout grid, fell free to try it :)

Most aspects of the grid are editable options in settings-sassy-grid.scss.
After changing settings, re-compile and viola!

//Grid options
$include-grid: true; (include grid in your compiled css?) <br />
$column-number: 12; (number of columns) <br />
$col-break-medium: 800px; (medium responsive breakpoint (max-width)) <br />
$col-break-small: 400px; (small responsive breakpoint (max-width)) <br />
$include-padding: true; (include padding property on each grid item) <br />
$padding: 20px; (padding around each grid item) <br />
