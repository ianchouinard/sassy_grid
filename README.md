# sassy_grid
Working on a lightweight grid layout with options.

My personal compass/sass layout grid, fell free to try it :)

Most aspects of the grid are editable options in settings-sassy-grid.scss.
After changing settings, re-compile and viola!

//Grid options
$include-grid: true;                //include grid in your compiled css?
$column-number: 12;                 //number of columns
$col-break-medium: 800px;           //medium responsive breakpoint (max-width)
$col-break-small: 400px;            //small responsive breakpoint (max-width)
$include-padding: true;             //include padding property on each grid item
$padding: 20px;                     //padding around each grid item
